          Rose Mary Hr. Sec. School Jahangirabad School is a Higher Secondary School for both girls and boys managed by Rose Mary Group. Rose Mary Group was established in 1991 and run by Mr Devendra Singh Ji. Our institution is recogniged by the Madhya Pradesh Board of education. Rose Mary School, Jahagirabad is committed to fostering excellence in education. We firmly believe that teaching is not about knowledge downloads, but opening the minds of young learners. We guide them towards learning, comprehensively focussing on the overall development of each student.
PHILOSOPHY BE WHAT YOU WANT TO BE Some people follow a path they choose on their own. They discover their true calling. They chase their dreams with passion, and excel in their chosen discipline. But, best of all, they become what they want to be. Presidium is the school for such people. It is our belief that a teacher's influence is for eternity. Our teachers, therefore, identify the interests and aspirations of students and, working closely with their parents, nourish their individual talents. Our faculty, by focusing on life skills and methodology, brings out the best in our students. We believe that every child is exceptional and has the potential to evolve into a dynamic person and fulfill his/her aspirations. At Rose Mary School, Jahangirabad every learner becomes who he or she is destined to be: A leader of tomorrow.
